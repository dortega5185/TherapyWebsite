            <span>What is counseling?</span>
            <p>
              In my opinion, counseling at its basic form is a commitment and
              investment in yourself or your relationship. It takes time, energy
              and costs money. Some parts will be fun, some uncomfortable. Most
              importantly I think of counseling as a process in which you are
              allowed to feel vulnerable and safe at the same time. You can heal
              parts of your past. You can become more secure and confident. You
              can establish healthy boundaries with those around you. You can
              have a healthy and supportive relationship. You can become whole
              and happy.{' '}

            <span>What is it like to be in counseling?</span>
            <p>
              Each of us are unique. We have led different lives, experienced
              different ups- different downs. My weakness may be your strength
              and vice versa. Because no 2 of us are the same, the process of
              counseling will not be. That being said there are common threads;
              you will not be judged and you won't feel alone.

            <span>Why should I see a therapist/counselor?</span>
            <p>
              Counseling isn't for everyone nor is it essential to go every week
              for your whole life. If you come in to counseling and don't feel
              like it's for you, that is completely fine. Some will get more
              benefit from different avenues of support. I at the very least can
              help you with other resources or ideas about how to get the help
              you deserve.

            <span>How does counseling work?</span>
            <p>
              Rarely are our minds calm and settled. We think about millions of
              things each and every day. We compare our lives to others, we are
              inundated with information about how we should look, what we
              should buy, how we should feel. Add in anxiety, depression, or low
              self-esteem to the mix and it's not difficult to imagine becoming
              overwhelmed. We have too many negative thoughts in our head, too
              many negative feelings in our heart to hold it all in. Counseling
              will provide a safe space for you to express yourself and release
              those thoughts/feelings. With less noise in your mind and body,
              you can begin to discover how you want to grow and what steps need
              to be taken to get there. My first priority is to never let you
              feel judged for what you say in a counseling session and to never
              let you feel alone in this journey.

            <span>How often should I come to counseling?</span>
            <p>
              Most women and couples come to counseling once or twice a week
              depending on what is needed at the time. Clients in crisis can
              greatly benefit from coming in twice per week then reduce to one
              session per week once things settle.

            <span>Why do you want to work with women?</span>
            <p>
              When I first entered into the field of counseling, I purposefully
              took on a variety of clients with a broad range of issues. I
              first, hoped to let my experience lead me to discover my niche and
              second, wanted to develop the skills to work with anyone. It
              didn't take long to uncover my passion of working with women. I
              love witnessing women transform into the best version of
              themselves. Whether it's dealing with a pattern of bad
              relationships, low self-esteem or an unexpected life change, I
              have seen many women start therapy without a voice or much hope
              and terminate with complete empowerment and strength.

            <span>Why do you want to work with couples?</span>
            <p>
              Relationships when they are good have the power to lift both
              individuals up. There is nothing quite like feeling completely
              supported by another person whom you love and care about. But
              sometimes life, present or past, gets in the way of a happy
              relationship. Maybe you have never learned how to deal with
              conflicts or there is something getting in the way of connecting
              fully. Infidelity, poor communication, lack of sexual intimacy are
              additional potential burdens placed relationships and in turn
              ourselves. When couples are in distress, it can suck your energy
              dry and life isn't very satisfying when you spend so much of your
              time arguing or feeling contemptuous. Couples counseling can be
              challenging but so greatly rewarding. It's amazing to see a couple
              move from a place of distress and dissatisfaction to complete
              commitment and love.
